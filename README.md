# FatsharkCodingTest

When I first saw the test, I noticed there were a lot of areas that I had not worked with before, such as SQLite and API calls.
This made the task feel quite daunting but I decided to do everything one at a time, which really helped out.
Because of my newly understanding of the areas I am was not sure what was good and bad practices, specially with WPF.
This became a really fun learning experience ones I managed to piece the different puzzle pieces together.


I chose to do the test in JetBrains Rider because im more used to it from my previous job experience. 
Now after doing the test I would have done it in Visual studio because they seem to have a lot more tools for WPF.
I also messed the .idea folder up a bit in the project but didnt have time to fix it sadly.

One of the biggest problems i encountered was to link commands to the datagrids events. After a lot of searching around I found a way that I felt was the cleanest.
I spent some time figuring out and testing ideas for how to display the largest groups of people close to each other. I started with a heatmap but couldn't really make the background map match the coordinates propperly.
So then I decided to just choose a clustering algorithm called K-Means which was quite easy to implement and gave decent results. 

I decided to display most of my data via plots because I felt that analyzed data is quite boring. Some of my time went into figuring out which plotting library fitted the needs of the program the best and ended up with OxyPlot.

I feel like I learned a lot of new things from this test which made the experience very valuable and fun.
I would greatly appriciate feedback on how I could improve. Specially in the WPF area.
